# Task Manager Application

## Overview
This is a simple **Task Manager** application built using **React.js** that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. The core functionality includes:
- Adding tasks with a title
- Deleting tasks from the list
- Storing tasks persistently in the browser using `localStorage`

### Features
- **Task Input**: Users can add tasks with a title.
- **Task Deletion**: Users can delete individual tasks from the list.
- **Task Persistence**: The tasks are stored in `localStorage`, so they persist across page reloads.
- **Task Search**: A search bar allows users to search for tasks by title.
- **Task Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed, which visually crosses them off the list.
- **Priority Setting**: Tasks can be assigned a priority level (High, Medium, Low).
- **Task Sorting**: Tasks can be sorted based on priority or completion status.
- **UI Animation**: Smooth animations are added to task list items, task addition, and deletion using **Framer Motion**.
